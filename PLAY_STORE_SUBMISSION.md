## Understanding Trusted Web Activities (TWAs)

Trusted Web Activities (TWAs) are the recommended way to deliver PWAs through the Play Store. They allow you to package your web app in an Android app that uses Chrome as a runtime.

### Key Features of TWAs:

1. **Full Screen Experience**: TWAs remove browser UI, providing a native-like experience
2. **Access to Web Platform APIs**: Your PWA can use modern web features like:
   - Push notifications
   - Background sync
   - Web Share API
   - Camera access
   - Geolocation
   
3. **Digital Asset Links**: Verifies the connection between your web app and Android app
   - Required file: `.well-known/assetlinks.json` on your website
   - Links your domain to your app's package name and signing certificate

4. **Performance Benefits**:
   - Shared Chrome runtime (no embedded browser)
   - Efficient caching of assets
   - Reduced app size compared to hybrid frameworks

### TWA Requirements:

- HTTPS website
- Valid Web App Manifest
- Service Worker for offline support
- Passes PWA criteria in Lighthouse audit

## Digital Asset Links Setup

When using PWABuilder or Bubblewrap, the tools will help generate the Digital Asset Links file. You'll need to:

1. Get the SHA-256 certificate fingerprint from your keystore
2. Create a `.well-known/assetlinks.json` file with:
   ```json
   [{
     "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
     "target": {
       "namespace": "android_app",
       "package_name": "com.yourswingbuddy.app",
       "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["YOUR_SHA256_FINGERPRINT"]
     }
   }]
   ```
3. Host this file at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
